Team members: Aaron St. Omer, Mankaranpreet Pandher, Saad Abdullah, Abdul Biderkab

The purpose of this project was to teach students and others financial literacy, included in this website is a fully functional database allowing people to create an account and login, and gain access to monthly spending trackers, financial calculator tools as well as the opportunity to book appointments with financial advisors or even financial classes. The backend was done in PHP with some html and css for style and visuals. We used mySQL for the database to allow each users login info and transaction history to be saved for the next time they login.
